## 1. [Check if a large number is divisible by 3 or not](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-large-number-divisible-3-not/)

**==A number is divisible by 3 if sum of its digits is divisible by 3.==**

For example, 
- Take a number $1332$.
- We can represent it as, 
	$1*1000 + 3*100 + 3*10 + 2*1$.
- Remainder of $10^{i}$ divided by 3 is always 1.
- So, 
	$= 1*1 + 3*1 + 3*1 + 2*1$  
	$= 1+3+3+2$
	$= 9$ 
- Now, $9$ is divisible by 3. So the number $1332$ is divisible by $3$.

## 2. [Check if a large number is divisible by 4 or not](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-large-number-divisible-4-not/)

**==A number is divisible by 4 if number formed by last two digits of it is divisible by 4.==**

For example,
- Take a number $76952$.
- Number formed by the last 2 digits is $52$.
- 52 is divisible by 4. (i.e. $52$%$4$ = $0$).
- So, $76952$ is divisible by $4$.

Proof,
- Also, represent as $7*10000 + 6*1000 + 9*100 + 5*10 + 2*1$.  
- Remainder of Power of $10^i$ is divided by $4$,  
	if $i>1$, 
	then the remainder will be 0. (i.e.  $100$%$4$ == $0$,  $10$%$4$ != $0$ ).
- So, result will be,
	$= 7*0 + 6*0 + 9*0 + 5*10 + 2*1$
	$= 0+0+0+50+2$
	$= 52$
- 52 is divisible by 4.
