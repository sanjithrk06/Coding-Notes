
# **Daily Notes**

## Overview
- The Daily Notes repo is my personal log to update and organize my daily activities. 
- I use it to record 
    - Research and development work related to my projects. 
    - My Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) notes, 
    - Solutions to problems I've solved,
- It's a dedicated space to systematically document my progress and ensure I have a detailed record for future reference.
